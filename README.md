 Greetings! Welcome to the repository housing my traffic accident data analysis project, which I finalized during my data science internship at `Prodigy Infotech`. This project encompasses tasks such as data cleaning, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating visualizations, and extracting insights from a dataset filled with traffic accident records.  
 
## Project Overview

 The aim of this project is to examine traffic accident data to uncover patterns and trends, pinpoint accident hotspots, and offer practical insights to aid in improving road safety measures.

 ## Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**: Imputed missing values, standardized data types, and ensured uniformity throughout the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examined variable distribution and relationships to unveil patterns and insights.
3. **Visualization**: Developed a variety of plots and charts to visually present the data and discoveries.

## Key Insights

- **City-wise Analysis**: Miami recorded the highest number of accidents, while Star Junction and Stromsburg reported the lowest.
- **State-wise Distribution**: California led in accident frequency, whereas South Dakota had the fewest accidents.
- **Trend Analysis**: The year 2021 marked the highest number of accidents.
- **Severity Patterns**: Majority of accidents were categorized as severity level 2.
- **Weather Conditions**: The majority of accidents occurred under fair weather conditions.
- **Time Patterns**: Morning hours experienced the highest accident rates.

## Summary

This analysis uncovers significant patterns in traffic accident data, showcasing high accident rates in densely populated regions like Miami and California. Moreover, a considerable number of accidents took place under fair weather conditions during morning hours. These findings can guide road safety initiatives and policy formulation to reduce accidents and enhance public safety.
